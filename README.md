#Builders author list
Uses the two files:
* builders.txt:  contains the author list, with affiliations and some other info.  Edit to modify ordering
* builders.py:  contains the script to generate builders.tex from builders.txt (`builders.txt [-s]`, optional -s will just print formatted list to screen)

To modify the order, you can set different groups in builders.py (lines 10 and 11), as well as the order in builders.txt.  Or, just do it in authors.tex.
