# Collaborator definitions from Collaboration Agreement:
#
# A __Sponsored_Collaborator__ is a Collaborator Sponsored by a Board Member and Approved by the HERA Executive 
# Board.  The act of Sponsoring confers the right of access to data and intellectual content as defined in 
# the Sponsoring statement and may include a Supervisory role.## A __Supervisor__ is a Board Member or Sponsored Collaborator with supervisory rights (e.g. thesis advisor
# or post-doctoral mentor) as recognized at their home institution.  Supervisors who are Sponsored 
# Collaborators must be Approved as such by the Executive Board, typically as part of the Sponsoring 
# statement or amendment.## A __Supervised_Collaborator__ is a Collaborator working under the aegis of a Supervisor.  ## A __Collaborator__ is an individual who participates in the Collaboration as recognized by the HERA Executive 
# Board.  In general, a Collaborator does not necessarily have access rights to HERA content.
